        <h3>!--upto 6 header from h1-h6 with various font sizes</h3> <hr>

        <hr>

        <p>A "private network" is restricted to specific users or organizations, meaning only authorized individuals can access it, while a "public network" is accessible to anyone, like a Wi-Fi network in a coffee shop, and is considered less secure due to the open access; essentially, private networks offer greater control and security compared to public networks. 
            Key differences:
            Access:
            Private networks limit access to authorized users only, while public networks allow anyone to connect. 
            Security: <br>
            Private networks
            are generally considered more secure due to controlled access and stricter security measures, whereas public networks are more vulnerable to cyberattacks. 
            Control:
            Organizations managing private networks have more control over who can access and use the network, while public networks are typically managed by service providers with less control over individual users. <hr>
            Example:
            A company's internal network is a private network, while a public Wi-Fi hotspot in a public place is a public network.</p>
